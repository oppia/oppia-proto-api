# oppia-proto-api
Published common proto API for the Oppia server/client.

This API governs the transfer of data between the Oppia Python server and the Android app. 

### API Versions
Each version of this API is formatted as a major & minor version (e.g. 1.0) and corresponds to a separate release.

- The major version is represented directly in the directory structure (e.g. 'v1'), and is only incremented if a breaking change must be introduced into the API. (Note that this repository might house multiple major versions, in order to maintain long-term backward compatibility with older API versions.)
- The minor version is incremented whenever a compatible change to the API is released. It is only ever represented in the release numbers, and never in code form.

Because protobuf is backward/forward interoperable, incompatibilities are unlikely as long as proto versions are respected (though, even in those cases, there should be potential for graceful failures). 

### Content Versions
Content versions represent the version of the corresponding entity instance (e.g. a topic, skill, or exploration). These are used to track whether a particular structure has content updates. They map to the versions stored in the corresponding structure's VersionedModel in the backend.

### Proto Versions
Proto versions correspond to the proto structures defined in this repository. They only need to be incremented when a proto structure is updated in such a way that the default data will break existing logical assumptions (thus requiring a data migration). Such upgrades should always happen in a compatible way (except for major API version upgrades -- see the "API Version" section above).

Three notes:

1. Some proto versions correspond to **groups** of substructures (such as SubtitledHtml, or other language-based substructures), because these substructures are shared across high-level structures.
2. There is no need to version interactions separately. This is because their structure and how they relate to the exploration/question experience is implied as part of State's structure version.
3. If any changes happen in the proto structure which are getting tracked, the version specified in the comment must be incremented.

The following are the list of structure types whose versions are tracked:
- TopicSummaryProtoVersion
- RevisionCardProtoVersion
- ConceptCardProtoVersion
- ExplorationProtoVersion
- QuestionProtoVersion
- StateProtoVersion
- LanguageProtosVersion
- ImageProtoVersion
